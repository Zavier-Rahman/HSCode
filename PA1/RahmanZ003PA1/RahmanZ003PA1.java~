/**
 * Method Purpose:  Users are prompted for the projected sales revenue, the number of sales reps, the number of 
 * quarters a rep has worked, the quarter(s) in which revenue was earned, and he sales revenue for each month within a 
 * quarter. If the sales rep is earning 50% or above their target, then an encouraging message is given; otherwise, a 
 * warning that sales are lagging. If sales revenue for the company is greater than or equal to 100% of projected 
 * annual sales, then employees qualify for a 2-5% year-end bonus; otherwise, the sales are not on track to meet 
 * projections, and no year-end bonus can be expected.
